        <h2>Young researchers "poster" mini-session</h2>

        <p class="smallmargintext">To give the chance to younger researchers to present their work and network with others, a special session will be held on February 17, 15:00 to 16:00, Madrid time. To mimic the experience of an in-place poster session, each participant will have a dedicated Zoom link, and attendees will be able to visit them and ask questions during the session time.</p>

        <p class="smallmargintext">Interested participants shall prepare up to 8 slides using the following PowerPoint template, and send them to Mario Merino (<a href="mailto:mario.merino@uc3m.es" target="_blank">mario.merino@uc3m.es</a>) no later than January 31, 2022.
        The slides will be posted to this website as they become available, enabling all attendees to access them and interact with their authors before the event through the discussion forum <a href="#discussion" class="scrolly"> indicated further below</a>.</p>
